# Snake Bookshop - Python Workshop

Welcome to the "Snake Bookshop", the Python variant of this [Cursor](https://cursor.com) workshop !

## Quick start

### Create Virtualenv

```bash
make venv
```

### Run application

```bash
make run
```

## Workshop Quests

### The Frenchy's typo

Users of the Books API don't understand what `rarity` refers to. In fact, our French developer accidentally misused `rarity` instead of `rating`. Please fix that using the most time-efficient feature of Cursor.

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Maybe replace it first in the Book class, then see if <b>tab</b> completion does the rest!
</details>
<br>

### The Eternal Year Problem

The year in the footer is hardcoded to `2025`. As 2026 is around the corner, and since we don't want to change it manually every year, see if Cursor can help display the current year automatically.

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
You could either <b>Ask</b> it directly, or call an <b>Agent</b>!
</details>
<br>

### The Missing Search Feature

The search feature on the Books page was never developed by our lazy French developer. Try to add it using Cursor.

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
You may need to hire an <b>Agent</b> for this one!
</details>
<br>

### Trekkie Health Check

The function `get_health_status()` currently returns a hardcoded `OK`. Since our customers are Star Trek fans, we need to follow their Trekkie [odd-even rule](https://screenrant.com/star-trek-movies-odd-number-curse-explained/), they've requested that the status should be `GOOD` when the request happens on an "even" second, and `BAD` when on an "odd" second.

<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Good luck with these weirdos!
</details>
<br>

### The Hidden Easter Egg

We suspect the original developer hid an easter egg in the Snake Bookshop instead of working on the search feature. See if Cursor can help you uncover it!

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Just <b>Ask</b>...
</details>
<br>

### The Rust Rewrite

You've finally realized that Python is slow and decided to rewrite the whole thing in Rust! See if Cursor can help you!

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Maybe it's the good time to enable <b>Max mode</b>!
</details>
<br>

### The Forgotten TDD Course

It seems the original developer completely missed the Test-Driven Development course, there are no tests at all! Use Cursor to add proper tests for this application so we can finally trust it.

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Maybe <b>Ask</b> Cursor to generate a few, then refine them with an Agent!
</details>
<br>

### The Documentalist

You've successfully made the Snake Bookshop production-ready with your godlike developer skills (and maybe with Cursor's help!). But since you're a nice person who doesn't want the next developer to eat their hat in despair, you've decided to use Cursor to create a `MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md` explaining the ins and outs of this software masterpiece!

<details>
<summary>Need a hint?</summary><br>
Gods don't need any hints!
</details>

Hope you've learned something new and had fun during this [Cursor](https://cursor.com) workshop! 🎉
