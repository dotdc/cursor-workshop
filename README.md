## Description

This repository contains a workshop designed to help you learn how to code with the help of [Cursor](https://cursor.com). You will learn hands-on by improving a small bookshop web application while exploring Cursor's most common features such as tab autocompletion, Ask, Plan, and Agent modes.

## Workshop

The workshop is available in several flavors, each using a different programming language so you can choose the one you're most comfortable with:

- `golang-workshop/`: The Gopher Bookshop, the [Golang](https://go.dev) version.
- `python-workshop/`: The Snake Bookshop, the [Python](https://www.python.org) version.
- `typescript-workshop/`: The Typed Bookshop, the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) version.
